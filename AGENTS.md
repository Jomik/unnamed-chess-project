Project-specific instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

ESP32-S3 smart chess board firmware in Rust, plus an iOS companion app (SwiftUI + CoreBluetooth). Hall-effect sensors detect per-color piece positions; LEDs provide move feedback. Uses `shakmaty` for chess logic. The companion app connects via BLE to configure players and start games. Supports human-vs-human and human-vs-remote (companion-managed) modes.

## Build and Test Commands

The default Cargo target is `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf` (set in `.cargo/config.toml`). **You must always pass `--target` explicitly or use `just` commands to avoid accidentally targeting ESP32.**

```bash
just test              # Run all host tests
just test -- test_name # Run a single test by name
just build             # Build ESP32 firmware
just build-diag        # Build diagnostics binary
just flash             # Flash to ESP32 and monitor serial
just flash-diag        # Flash diagnostics binary and monitor serial
```

### iOS Companion App

The companion app is at `companion/ChessBoard/`. It uses XcodeGen to generate the Xcode project from `project.yml`.

```bash
just companion-build   # Generate .xcodeproj + build for simulator
just companion-test    # Generate .xcodeproj + run tests
just companion-open    # Generate .xcodeproj + open in Xcode
just companion-fmt     # Format Swift code (swift-format)
just companion-lint    # Check Swift formatting (strict, errors on violations)
```

Requires Xcode 26+, XcodeGen (`brew install xcodegen`), and swift-format (`brew install swift-format`). BLE does not work in the simulator — use a physical device for end-to-end testing.

For physical device deployment, copy `companion/ChessBoard/Local.xcconfig.template` to `Local.xcconfig` and set your `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` ID.

### Linting

```bash
just fmt                # Format code
just clippy             # Run clippy on host (warnings are errors)
just clippy-esp         # Run clippy for ESP32 target
just check              # Run fmt + clippy + test
just check-all          # Run check + clippy-esp
```

CI treats clippy warnings as errors (`-D warnings`). **Never run `cargo +esp` directly** — always use `just` recipes, which load `IDF_PATH` from `.env` via `set dotenv-load`. Running `cargo +esp` without `IDF_PATH` corrupts the ESP-IDF setup.

`cargo fmt` works on **all** source files regardless of `#[cfg]` gating. Always run it even for ESP-only files. Only `clippy` and `test` require the correct target.

Swift CI (`.github/workflows/swift_ci.yml`) runs lint and build+test checks on every PR using the `macos-26` runner.

## Conditional Compilation

Two mutually exclusive code paths based on target:

| Context | Target | Active modules |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-S3 firmware | `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf` (`target_os = "espidf"`) | `esp32::*` |
| Host (dev/test) | host triple (e.g. `aarch64-apple-darwin`) | `testutil::*` (test-only) |

Gate hardware-specific code with `#[cfg(target_os = "espidf")]`. Never mix imports across the boundary. All test modules use plain `#[cfg(test)]`.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
BleCommands (mpsc channel) → BleCommand
    → main.rs orchestrates BoardState state machine: Idle → AwaitingPieces → InProgress
    → BLE commands are drained each tick regardless of state
    → In AwaitingPieces, sensors are checked non-blockingly for starting position
    → session.tick() is only called in InProgress state
    → BleNotifier pushes state back to characteristics
PieceSensor::read_positions() → ByColor<Bitboard>
    → GameSession::tick(sensors) → TickResult (only when InProgress)
        → Player::poll_move() detects/computes move
        → compute_feedback(position, sensors, reference_sensors) → BoardFeedback
            → BoardDisplay::show(&feedback)
```

**GameSession** (`session.rs`) orchestrates the per-tick sequence: poll active player → apply move → notify opponent → compute feedback. `main.rs` also manages the `BoardState` state machine: transitions from Idle (no game) to AwaitingPieces (waiting for start position setup) to InProgress (game is active). BLE commands are drained every tick regardless of state.

### Key Abstractions

- **PieceSensor** (`lib.rs`) — sensor input (ESP32 hardware / test scripted)
- **BoardDisplay** (`lib.rs`) — visual output (ESP32 LEDs)
- **Player** (`player/mod.rs`) — symmetric trait for both human and computer players

### Module Responsibilities

- **player/mod.rs** — `Player` trait (`poll_move`, `opponent_moved`, `is_interactive`, `notify`), `PlayerStatus` enum, `GameAction` enum for game-level actions (resign, future draw/takeback)
- **player/human.rs** — `HumanPlayer`: detects moves from sensor bitboards by matching against legal moves
- **player/remote.rs** — `RemotePlayer`: receives moves from an external source (e.g. BLE SubmitMove) via an mpsc channel
- **feedback.rs** — `compute_feedback` and `compute_state_feedback`: feedback from position + sensors. Recovery guidance is integrated as a fallback path.
- **board_api.rs** — Transport-agnostic domain types from `docs/board-api.md`: `GameStatus`, `PlayerType`, `BoardApiError`. `GameSession` returns these directly; BLE encoding lives in `ble_protocol`.
- **session.rs** — `GameSession`: owns chess position + two `Box<dyn Player>`, produces `TickResult` per sensor frame; also exposes `resign()`, `is_game_over()`, and `game_state()` for game lifecycle management
- **ble_protocol.rs** — `BleCommand`, `CommandResult`, `CommandSource`, `ErrorCode`, UUID constants, binary encoding/decoding for `board_api` types (`PlayerType`, `GameStatus`, move encoding). Platform-independent, host-testable.
- **esp32/sensor.rs** — `Esp32PieceSensor`: ADC + mux scanning, `RawScan` for raw millivolt readings, `read_raw()` primitive
- **esp32/ble.rs** — `start_ble()` initializes NimBLE and returns `BleCommands` (command receiver) + `BleNotifier` (characteristic updater). Single Game GATT service with typed characteristic handles for game status, player types, moves, and position.
- **esp32/config.rs** — `SensorCalibration` NVS load/save (cal partition), `CalibrationError`, `SensorConfig`, `LedPalette`, `Rgb8` display/sensor configuration types
- **setup.rs** — pre-game feedback showing which starting-position squares still need pieces
- **testutil/script.rs** — `ScriptedSensor` with BoardScript mini-language for tests

### Move Detection Constraints

- Promotions are always to Queen (no piece-selection mechanism on hardware)
- A move executes when pieces are placed, not just lifted
- Illegal physical states are silently ignored; the player waits for a valid position

### BoardScript Format (for tests)

Used by `ScriptedSensor` in `testutil/script.rs` and extensively in `player/human.rs` tests:

```
"e2 We4."      → lift e2, place white on e4, tick
"e2. We4."     → lift e2 (tick), place white on e4 (tick)
"e7 Be5. g1 Wf3."  → two moves in sequence
```

- Squares: `e2`, `a1`, `h8`. Optional `W`/`B` color prefix required when placing on an empty square.
- Period `.` flushes the current group and queues a tick.

## Provisioning

On boot the board enters BLE advertising mode with the name "ChessBoard". The iOS companion app connects via BLE, configures players, and starts games. Only sensor calibration data is persisted to NVS (in the separate `cal` partition). The companion app persists last-used player config to UserDefaults.

`just erase-nvs` clears the main NVS partition. It does not affect sensor calibration.

The `IDF_PATH` build variable can still be set in `.env` (loaded via the justfile's `set dotenv-load`).

See `docs/specs/2026-03-31-ble-companion-app-design.md` for the full design.

## Sensor Calibration

Per-board sensor calibration (baseline voltage, detection threshold) is stored in NVS. The diagnostics binary (`src/bin/diagnostics.rs`, flashed via `just flash-diag`) runs a 3-phase pipeline: assembly check (LED sweep → empty board scan → starting position scan), calibration (derives threshold from measured noise floor and weakest piece signal), and change-based diagnosis (logs sensor changes to identify noisy squares).

The production firmware loads calibration from NVS on boot, falling back to `SensorConfig::default()` if uncalibrated.

Calibration data lives in a separate `cal` NVS partition from the main `nvs` partition. This means `just erase-nvs` does not wipe calibration. Use `just erase-cal` to force recalibration.

See `docs/specs/2026-03-28-sensor-diagnostics-design.md` for the full design.

## Coding Conventions

- Error types: use `thiserror` with proper enums (never `()` as error type)
- No `unwrap()` in production code; `expect()` only where failure is logically impossible
- Prefer iterators over index-based loops, borrowing over cloning
- All public types implement `Debug` at minimum
