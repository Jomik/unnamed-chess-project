# rust-analyzer configuration for host-based analysis.
#
# The project defaults to the ESP32 target (xtensa-esp32-espidf) with
# build-std enabled in .cargo/config.toml. Without this override,
# rust-analyzer attempts to build std from source for the ESP target,
# which requires the full ESP toolchain.
#
# Setting the cargo target to your host triple makes rust-analyzer use
# the prebuilt standard library, enabling analysis of mock modules,
# tests, and integration tests. ESP32-gated code (src/esp32/) will not
# be analyzed — CI covers that.
#
# To use: copy this file to rust-analyzer.toml and set your host target.
#
#   cp rust-analyzer.toml.example rust-analyzer.toml
#
# Common host targets:
#   macOS (Apple Silicon): aarch64-apple-darwin
#   macOS (Intel):         x86_64-apple-darwin
#   Linux (x86_64):        x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
#   Windows (MSVC):        x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
#
# Find yours with: rustc -vV | grep host
